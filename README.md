Python code to simulate the UEFA Champions League Draw.  Swiss tournament format from 2024/25 season onwards.

36 teams are split into 4 pots based on UEFA co-efficient ranking.

Each team plays 2 different opponents from each pot. One at home and one away.

A club cannot play against another club of its country.

Clubs cannot play more than 2 clubs of the same country.

As a result of these numerous complexities. UEFA are allegedly using an "AI-facilitated supercomputer" to determine the draw.

The algorithm will run until complete and writes the draw to a dataframe. This can be exported with pandas.DataFrame.to_excel() 

CSV files with club details for both Champions and Europa Leagues are included for hours of endless fun. Similar to the real draw.
