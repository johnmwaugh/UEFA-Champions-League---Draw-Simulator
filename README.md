Python code to simulate the UEFA Champions League Draw.  Swiss tournament format from 2024/25 season onwards.

    36 teams are split into 4 pots based on UEFA co-efficient ranking.
    Each team plays 2 different opponents from each pot. One at home and one away.
    A club cannot play against another club of its country.
    Clubs cannot play more than 2 clubs of the same country.

    The algorithm will run until complete and writes the draw to a dataframe. This can be exported with pandas.DataFrame.to_excel() 
    
    CSV files with club details for both Champions and Europa Leagues are included.

    Many thanks to Zippy for his unvaluable help with this project.
    
    UEFA are allegedly using an "AI-facilitated supercomputer" to determine the draw.
